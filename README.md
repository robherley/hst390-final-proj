## The Rules:

You must apply at least 5 concepts from class discussions to your data analysis.

You must have 20 long-form interviews, survey data (higher numbers are great, but may be difficult to get), review of relevant research already completed, and at least 6 instances of observable ethnographic data (this can be from online observations).

[Include these in a separate file folder with your final project itself.]

__If you’re doing an interactive website, you must have a data page, a research page, a project description page that includes a discussion of your methods, a findings page, a visuals page, and a page for links to similar research.__

If you’re writing a traditional paper, please note that length is 20 pages (can include no more than 5 pages of graphs/pictures/visuals).

If you’re recording a podcast, the minimum length is 45 minutes. You may use interview recordings as part of this – but no more than 10 minutes. You may also use other recordings (from movies, commercials, etc.), but no more than 5 minutes of this.

If you’re doing a video, the minimum length is 15 minutes. This is a lot when it comes to video, but doable. You may insert graphs/visuals/other media, but it may take up no more than 5 minutes.

## The Grades:

An “A” project will fulfill all the requirements, show evidence of deep engagement with your research questions, show evidence of thorough analysis of data, have a strong argument based in your findings, and be creative.

They don’t have to be “perfect” quality to be an “A” project – so do NOT kill yourself in editing or beautifying. Unless you want to because you’re really into it, then be my guest.

_Projects are due to me by the end of the scheduled final exam date/time. There is no "final exam"._
