## The Rules:

You must apply at least 5 concepts from class discussions to your data analysis.

You must have 20 long-form interviews, survey data (higher numbers are great, but may be difficult to get), review of relevant research already completed, and at least 6 instances of observable ethnographic data (this can be from online observations).

[Include these in a separate file folder with your final project itself.]

**If youâ€™re doing an interactive website, you must have a data page, a research page, a project description page that includes a discussion of your methods, a findings page, a visuals page, and a page for links to similar research.**
